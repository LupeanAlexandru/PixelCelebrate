## SQL Server with LocalDB

This project uses **SQL Server** with **LocalDB** to manage the database. LocalDB is a lightweight version of SQL Server designed for development purposes, offering an easy-to-use database solution without the need for a full SQL Server installation.

### Prerequisites

- **SQL Server LocalDB**: Ensure that SQL Server Express LocalDB is installed on your system. You can download and install it from [Microsoft's official website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools?view=sql-server-ver15).
  
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** (optional but recommended): You can use SSMS to manage your LocalDB instance and interact with the database more easily. Download it [here](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup).

### Setting Up LocalDB

1. **Starting LocalDB**:
   LocalDB is typically started automatically when you connect to it. If not, you can start it manually using the following command in the command prompt or terminal:

   ```bash
   sqllocaldb start


2. **Connecting to LocalDB**:
   To connect to the LocalDB instance, use the following connection string in your projectâ€™s configuration or connection settings:

   ```plaintext
   Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=YourDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=True;
